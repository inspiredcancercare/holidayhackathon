Data and details of the INSPiRED Holiday Hackathon


FROM: Santas Elves workshop@northpole.com
TO: MD Anderson Data Scientists 
Subject: Data Science to Optimize Christmas Card Workflows.  

1.	Finding appropriate quotes 
We want to make more diverse and interesting Christmas cards using famous quotes about Christmas. The problem is that we‚Äôre too busy making presents to read a lot of quotes and decide if they are suitable to put on our cards. Can you please make us a tool which will help us decide if a quote is about Christmas or not? 
2.	Finding pictures of Santa
Now that we have some quotes to use on our cards, we need some pictures. We‚Äôd like to include pictures of Santa Claus. We were able to get a huge folder of photos but not all of them are of Santa! Can you help us by making a tool to decide if a picture contains Santa or not? 
Thank you so much for all your help, 

The Elves!
